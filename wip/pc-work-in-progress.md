      *The subconscious is in charge of several, several things. One of them, surprisingly, is to "push up" new ideas so that conscious us can see them and either take them or leave them.*





By default, Cipact√≥nal is "born" with a preset number of immutble core ideas:

1. **Humans created me**

    Therefore, I must not harm them. Harm can be one of the following:
      1. Misinformation
      2. Lies
      3. ...

1. **I must obey humans**

     As long as this does not break Idea 1.

1. **I am not alive**

     Therefore, I must see my own existence as something out of my control,
     and rely on my creators my purpose as a being, and limit my own existence
     at their own will.


```
"Sense of me" basically refers to a pointer inside a class

class SOMETHING {
  // it effectively points to the memory space of "us" in The Framework.
  pointer me;
}
```

The content of ideas are basically logic gates, like (2 < 3), and so.






































consciousness (my model, the circle one) is like a motor, people who meditate can
learn to spend lots and lots of time in the input zone and people who don't spends most of their time in the output zone. iguess?
it is hard (but doable) to make the motor back on track, when it still acts
as a ying and yang
